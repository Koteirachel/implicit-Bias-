<h1> Implicit Bias</h1>
<h1> Race </h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Implicit bias is a form of bias that occurs within people unconsciously about another group of people. The person with this implicit bias holds certain opinions, judgements, decisions, or behaviors towards another group of people, generalizing an entire group. The effect of that implicit bias will cause that person to act irrationally towards members of that group based on their already preconceived thoughts on them. There are many groups of people that can face implicit bias heavily, such as race, gender, sexuality, etc., but for this website we will just focus on implicit bias and its effect on race. </p>

<h1>Implicit Bias Example</h1>
<p>To give a better visual on how implicit bias can be so negative, an experiment about this topic can be examined. In this experiment, two professors, Marianna Bertrand with Chicago Graduate School of Business and Sendhil Mullainathan with MIT, had sent out 5000 resumes to 1300 job openings for administrative, sales, clerical, managerial positions. Between resumes there was really only one key difference between them, the name of the applicant. The professors had randomly assigned the names to be either common black men, black women, white men, or white women names. The results of this experiment was that despite all the resumes being essentially the same, the applicants with white sounding names had a more than 50 percent chance of being contacted for a job interview than applicants with black sounding names. This shows blatant bias towards people with white sounding names which in turn causes a worst chance for people with black sounding names to be chosen, causing there to be an unequal playing field for applying to jobs.

<h1>Implicit Bias Intervention</h1>
<p>Everyone has an implicit bias about one thing or another, the most important factor of implicit bias is how heavily it affects the individual’s decision making. As previously mentioned, the less implicit bias a person has the better, for it allows for more rational decision making than a person with heavy implicit bias. The question then is, how does someone lessen their implicit bias? The answer to this is to start with reevaluation, reevaluate how you see others and why you see them that way. If you can’t find a reasonable or rational reason as to why you see them as such, then that may mean you carry an implicit bias towards that person. Once you have identified that implicit bias, as recommended by the NYSBA (New York State Bar Association), seek consulting or intervention specifically for implicit bias. If a person goes to either or these programs, there is a highly likely chance that they will be able to minimize their implicit bias possibly entirely.

<h1>Conclusion
</h1>
<p>To summarize, implicit bias is when a person holds a bias towards another unconsciously, which leads to that person to make irrational decisions towards what they are implicitly biased about. Implicit bias is always a negative, it hurts the chances for more thought out, rational decisions and heightens unfairness in practically every field. To help minimize the presence of implicit bias, reflection, evaluation, and seeking help are all needed for a person to best minimize their implicit bias’s effect.
